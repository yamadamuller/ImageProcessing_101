# About the repository
The ImageProcessing_UTFPR repo contains supporting codes for the Image Processing (ELTD2) lectures ministered by Prof. Gustavo B. Borba from the Federal University of Technology - Paran√° (UTFPR). 
Currently, the validation and showcase codes are separated by topic, and all the functions can be accessed in the respective static classes of the directories.
